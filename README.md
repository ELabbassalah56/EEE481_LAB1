* Basics of BER calculations and channel models
# Introduction
* This is the first experiment in the Digital Communications Lab. In this experiment, we study the most basic method for assessing the performance of digital communication   systems, the Bit Error Rate. We also study simple models for communication channels and their effect on the communication system from the perspective of bit error rate.
# About the lab
* The digital communications lab consists of a set of experiments which introduce essential digital communication concepts to students. The lab consists mainly of MATLAB-based  experiments in which the students complete the required tasks of the experiment by writing MATLAB codes. Some experiments of the lab may consist of hardware-based experiments which are performed in the digital communication laboratory on campus.
